Game Criteria and Rules:

    For this game, the computer randomly chooses a letter a-z.
    
    The player must try to guess the letter the computer chose by selecting one key at a time on the keyboard
    
    The player has ten guesses to pick the correct letter.  If the player does not pick the correct letter after ten gueses, they lose and the game restarts after recording the completed game as either a win or loss for the player.  Letter guesses are not case-sensetive.
    
    If the player picks the correct letter, the player wins.
    
    The player will receive an alert if they select a non-letter and this will not be counted as one of the ten guesses
    
    The program records the letters that the player has guessed during each game and will alert the player to select a different letter for their guess if they select a letter that was already guessed during that iteration of the game.
    
    After either the player wins by guessing the correct letter or loses by guessing incorrectly ten times, the win or loss event will be tallied on the scoreboard and the number of guesses will reset to ten (the list of guessed letters will also reset after a win or loss event).  
    
    The computer will then randomly select a letter and the game will start again when the user submits their guess.
